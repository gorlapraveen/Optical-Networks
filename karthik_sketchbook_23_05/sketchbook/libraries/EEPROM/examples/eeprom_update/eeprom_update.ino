/***
   EEPROM Update method

   Stores values read from analog input 0 into the EEPROM.
   These values will stay in the EEPROM when the board is
   turned off and may be retrieved later by another sketch.

   If a value has not changed in the EEPROM, it is not overwritten
   which would reduce the life span of the EEPROM unnecessarily.

    Wrapping the EEPROM address.

    Larger AVR processors have larger EEPROM sizes, E.g:
    - Arduino Duemilanove: 512b EEPROM storage.
    - Arduino Uno:         1kb  EEPROM storage.
    - Arduino Mega:        4kb  EEPROM storage.

    Rather than hard-coding the length, you should use the pre-provided length function.
    This will make your code portable to all AVR processors that support EEPROM storage.
